# gifmaker2021
Video to gif magician.

Gui made in TKinter for moviepy to convert videos to GIFs.
You can set gif resolution, start and end point, and frames per second.

needs moviepy and tkinter,
pip install moviepy
sudo apt install python3-tk

Haven't been able to create an executable for windows yet.
Shift+right click in the folder and "open powershell window here" and run "python gifmaker.py" is the easiest way to run it on windows.

On Ubuntu "chmod u+x gifMaker.py" and changing "Behavior" -> "Executable Text Files" in Filemanager Preferences to "Run them" or "Ask what to do"(recommended).
